    <h2>Pale Blue Dot</h2>
    <p>
      "We succeeded in taking that picture, and, if you look at it, you see a
      dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it, everyone you ever heard
      of, every human being who ever lived, lived out their lives. The aggregate
      of all our joys and sufferings, thousands of confident religions,
      ideologies and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero
      and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilizations, every king and
      peasant, every young couple in love, every hopeful child, every mother and
      father, every inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every
      corrupt politician, every superstar, every supreme leader, every saint and
      sinner in the history of our species, lived there on a mote of dust,
      suspended in a sunbeam."
